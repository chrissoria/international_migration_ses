\begin{abstract}
Caribbean and adjacent Latin American countries are key sources of
Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. There has been rapid growth in the older
adult Hispanic populations both among immigrants in the U.S. and in
their home countries of emigration. This paper supports hypothesis
generation for international comparative Hispanic aging studies by
comparing older adult sociodemographic characteristics of U.S.
immigrants versus those in sending countries. The analysis also provides
context for the global family of health and retirement studies in the
region including the ongoing Caribbean American Dementia and Aging Study
(CADAS) which is collecting harmonized data on healthy aging in Puerto
Rico, Dominican Republic, and Cuba. We analyze census microdata from
these countries along with other major Hispanic Caribbean-adjacent
sending countries including Mexico, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala,
and Honduras. We compare older adults in these sending countries to
country-specific immigrant samples in the U.S. American Community
Survey, focusing on socioeconomic differences such as education, as well
as marital status and co-residence patterns related to caregiver
availability. We also examine differences by citizenship and immigration
age to further explore immigrant selectivity patterns. The highly varied
experiences of these cohorts will help inform future comparative
research on Hispanic healthy aging.

\subsection{Introduction and Background}\label{sec-intro}

Caribbean and adjacent Central and South American countries are key
sources of Hispanic immigrants to the United Sates (Passel 2024). In
2022, people of Mexican origin made up nearly 60\% of the U.S. Hispanic
population, totaling about 37.4 million. Puerto Ricans were the next
largest group at 5.9 million, with an additional 3.2 million living on
the island. Salvadorans, Cubans, Dominicans, Guatemalans, Colombians,
and Hondurans each have populations exceeding 1 million in the United
States (Noe-Bustamante 2023).

These immigrant populations include a rapidly growing subgroup who are
aged 65 and above, among whom there is wide variation in socioeconomic
and caregiving resources. In this paper we explore sociodemographic
variation of U.S. older adult immigrants by country and cohort of
emigration, and compare these U.S. immigrants to the corresponding
cohorts of older adults in their home countries of emigration.

The paper is designed to support hypothesis generation for international
comparative Hispanic aging studies. This includes providing background
context for the global family of health and retirement studies in the
region such as the ongoing Caribbean American Dementia and Aging Study
(CADAS) which is collecting harmonized data on healthy aging in Puerto
Rico, Dominican Republic, and Cuba (Llibre-Guerra et al. 2021). We
analyze census microdata from these countries along with other major
Hispanic Caribbean-adjacent sending countries including Mexico,
Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. We compare older adults
in these sending countries to country-specific immigrant samples in the
U.S. American Community Survey, focusing on socioeconomic differences
such as education, as well as marital status and co-residence patterns
related to caregiver availability. We also examine differences by
citizenship and immigration age to further explore immigrant selectivity
patterns. The highly varied experiences of these cohorts will help
inform future comparative research on Hispanic healthy aging.

\subsection{Literature Review}\label{sec-lit}

International migration patterns are shaped by a complex interplay of
factors, labor market demands, educational opportunities, and political
and economic instability (McAuliffe, Bauloz, and Kitimbo 2024). In North
America specifically, Massey et al.~argue that a primary driver of
migration is social networks, where migrants often seek to reunite with
family members, a motivation that leads to self-perpetuating cycle of
migration flows (Massey et al. 1994). Latin American countries exemplify
these diverse migration drivers, with specific political agreements
further influencing movement patterns.

Puerto Rico's unique status since 1898, for example, has facilitated
legal entry to the U.S. mainland for its residents. Similarly, the Cuban
Adjustment Act of 1966 granted Cuban natives or citizens who had settled
in the United States for at least one year the ability to apply for
lawful permanent residency3. This policy led to significant waves of
Cuban migration, notably the 1980 Mariel boatlift, which brought
approximately 125,000 Cubans to Florida4. The subsequent ``wet foot, dry
foot'' policy, implemented in 1995, further shaped Cuban migration until
its termination in 2017 by the Obama administration5.

Research consistently demonstrates that fluctuations in Puerto Rico's
economy, coupled with changes in labor demand on the mainland, are
primary drivers of migration flows (Capielo Rosario et al. 2023).

Older populations have their own reasons for staying or moving, although
migration is primarily a young man's game.

\subsection{Data and Methods}\label{sec-methods}

Census data for this study were obtained from IPUMS International
(Ruggles et al. 2024). The current analysis draws on the latest
harmonized census data available in IPUMS for Colombia (2005), Cuba
(2012), the Dominican Republic (2010), El Salvador (2007), Guatemala
(2002), Honduras (2001), Mexico (2020), Puerto Rico (2010), and the
United States (2020). The study focused on individuals aged 65 to 89, as
some datasets, such as Puerto Rico's, top-coded ages at 89. To ensure
comparability, we standardized means in the international censuses based
on the U.S. sex-specific age distribution. We also applied weights
provided by IPUMS to make the samples nationally representative.

Table 1 presents means of sociodemographics of all 65-89 year-olds from
each country's census. The variables included are age, percent
married/cohabiting, and highest educational level obtained (using
internationally standardized categorizations of less than primary,
primary, secondary, and university). Table 2 displays means for each
country's counterparts who have emigrated to the U.S. In addition to the
variables in Table 1, it includes percent English speakers, percent
naturalized citizens, mean age at immigration, and mean years in the
U.S. based on the American Community Survey data. Table 3 shows the same
variables as in Table 2, drawn from the American Community, but
categorized by race/ethnicity and nativity status.

\subsection{Preliminary Results}\label{preliminary-results}

\subsubsection{Hispanic older adults in their native
countries}\label{hispanic-older-adults-in-their-native-countries}

Table 1 shows sex-specific sociodemographic characteristics among older
adults aged 65 to 89, comparing across current country of residence in
the Hispanic Caribbean and adjacent countries. Rates of current
marriage/cohabitation are substantially higher among men than women;
among women, they vary significantly across countries, ranging from 38\%
in the Dominican Republic to 48\% in the U.S. Regarding education, there
are even larger differences between neighboring countries. E.g., among
women in this age group, 76\% of Dominicans have less than primary
education compared with 31\% of Cubans and Puerto Ricans; the highest
rate is Honduras at 86\% and lowest is the U.S. at 4\%. There are
similarly large differences among men . \#\#\# Hispanic older adults as
migrants in the U.S.

Table 2 presents sociodemographics of migrants from these countries
living in the U.S. The youngest groups are men from El Salvador (71.23),
Guatemala (70.78), and Honduras (71.5), who are about two years younger
than their counterparts in their native. The oldest group consists of
Cuban women (73.35), who are slightly younger than U.S. women overall
(73.75), while Cuban men (74.6) are older than the U.S. average for men
(73.13). These differences reflect a combination of differential
mortality rates and varying immigration patterns by birth cohort.
Marital/cohabitation status is also affected by these factors as well as
potentially by different cultural influences on partnership; for many
countries rates are somewhat lower among immigrants in the U.S. For
example, the age-adjusted married/cohabiting rate among women in Cuba is
43\%, compared to 31\% for Cuban-born women immigrants in the U.S.

Many of these migrant groups have low rates of reporting that they speak
English, with women generally less likely to speak English than men. The
lowest English speaking rates are among migrants from the Dominican
Republic, where only 60\% of female and 70\% of male migrants speak
English, and Mexico, with 65\% of female and 74\% of males speaking
English. In contrast, migrants from Cuba (71\% of females and 78\% of
males), Colombia (83\% of females and 88\% of males), and Guatemala
(79\% of females and 87\% of males) have higher English speaking rates.

In terms of citizenship, females are slightly more likely to become
naturalized U.S. citizens than men. Typically, men emigrate to the U.S.
at a younger age, about two years earlier on average. For example,
females from Honduras arrive at an average age of 36.48, while males
arrive at 34.42, often resulting in longer U.S. residency for
men---Honduran men report an average of 37.16 years compared to women's
36.17 years. However, Guatemala is an exception; despite migrating at a
younger age (32.05), Guatemalan men have spent fewer years in the U.S.
(38.75) compared to women (39.26).

Men are more likely to have a college degree across all groups:
Guatemalan men (12\%) compared to women (8\%), Honduran men (14\%)
versus women (11\%), and Salvadoran men (10\%) against women (5\%). The
largest gender gap is among Colombian migrants, with 24\% of men holding
a college degree compared to 16\% of women. The least educated groups
are Mexican migrants (6\% of men and 4\% of women with college degrees)
and those from the Dominican Republic (9\% for men and 7\% for women).
These relative gender patterns are similar to their counterparts living
in their native countries (Table 1), however overall the U.S. migrants
have markedly higher education than those still living in their
countries of birth.

\subsubsection{Race/ethnicity and nativity in
U.S.}\label{raceethnicity-and-nativity-in-u.s.}

Table 3 is similar to table 2, but now looks by racial category (Black,
White, and Other racial identities), Hispanic, and native-born category.
Average ages across these groups are quite similar. Both Hispanic
migrant and native Blacks are much less likely to be married or
cohabitating, with rates of 28\% and 27\%, respectively. In contrast,
individuals identifying as White, whether Hispanic migrant or native,
are more likely to be married or cohabitating. Black migrants are
slightly more likely to speak English but are less likely to become
naturalized citizens. They also tend to immigrate at an older age and
spend fewer years in the U.S., while Whites and those of other Hispanic
races have similar immigration patterns. White Hispanic migrants have
slightly longer U.S. residency. Interestingly, the college degree gap
between Black and White migrants is nonexistent; both groups are equally
likely to earn a degree. This contrasts with non-Hispanic US native
populations, where only 17\% of Black men hold a college degree compared
to 36\% of White men. Hispanic migrants identifying as a race other than
White or Black are the least likely to have a college degree and most
likely to have less than primary education, with 33\% of women and 32\%
of men in this category having less than a primary education.

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}

This study will provide a comprehensive sociodemographic comparison of
older adult Hispanic populations both in their countries of origin and
as immigrants in the United States. The analysis so far reveals
significant variations in education levels marital status and migration
patterns across different Hispanic subgroups. These findings have
important implications for understanding the diverse experiences of
Hispanic older adults and for informing policies related to healthy
aging and caregiving. The ongoing analysis (to be reported in the full
paper) is expanding this analysis to further examine patterns by
immigration cohort, also using multivariate regression to better parse
mechanisms underlying the observed differences.
