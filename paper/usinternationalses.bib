	abstract = {Background Latinos represent the fastest growing proportion of dementia cases among different ethnic groups. Most of the studies in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) include Latino populations within the same group, failing to sufficiently account for the real richness of linguistic, ethnic, ancestry, cultural, and socioeconomic diversity represented across Latino communities (e.g., Caribbean-Hispanic vs Non Caribbean-Hispanics), yet there is substantial AD disparities and disease heterogeneity among Hispanic groups. Methods The Caribbean-American Dementia and Aging Study (CADAS) is a multinational initiative aimed to answer key questions regarding dementia determinants and consequences in Caribbean-origin populations in origin communities as well as among emigrant populations in the United States. By building a collaborative team of leading Caribbean and U.S-based dementia researches, CADAS will analyze differences in dementia prevalence and risk factor profiles between Caribbean-Hispanics living in the main Hispanic Caribbean Islands and extend comparisons to Hispanic immigrant groups in the US as well as non-Hispanic whites, exploiting the considerable difference in life course risk exposures across these populations. Results Preliminary findings from the CADAS study indicate that prevalence of dementia in the older Caribbean population is high, both in the main islands and in U.S. compared to non-Hispanic-whites. We found overall weaker associations between education and dementia probability in the three main Caribbean islands. By contrast, a stronger association between education and dementia probability was found in the US among non-Hispanic whites, Mexican Hispanics, and non-Mexican Hispanics; these persist even after controlling for income and wealth. Conclusions There are differential associations between SES risk factors, education, and dementia probability between Caribbean islands and the U.S., which may be attributed to differences across societies in risk factors correlated with education. The CADAS study will fill a critical gap in AD knowledge, exploiting rich variation in life-course exposures to better disentangle genetic versus environmental determinants of dementia levels and disparities. Future studies within this populations will focus on early-life socioeconomic status, gene by environment interactions and societal cost.},

Our review of literature on Puerto Rican migration to the United States reveals that this migration is primarily associated with cycles of economic turmoil that result from over a century of U.S. colonialism in Puerto Rico. We also discuss how the pre- and post-migration context Puerto Ricans face influence their mental health. Emerging theory suggests that Puerto Rican migration to the United States should be conceptualized as colonial migration. Within this framework, researchers argue that U.S. colonialism in Puerto Rico not only creates the conditions that help explain why Puerto Ricans migrate to the United States but also the circumstances they encounter upon migration.},

	abstract = {Although all nations in the America’s face a common demographic reality of longevity, declining fertility rates and changes in family roles a growing body of research points to a dramatic demographic transformation in Mexico. Although Mexico’s population is relatively young, with a median age of 27.9 in 2015, it will age rapidly in coming years, increasing to 42 years by 2050. The rapid median age in the nation also reflects the growing proportion of people 65 or older, and is expected to triple to 20.2\% by 2050. This article examines how the age and gender structure of Mexico offers important insights about current and future political and social stability, as well as economic development. Mexico is the world’s eleventh largest country in terms of population size and the “demographic dividend” of a large youthful population is giving way to a growing older population that will inevitably place demands on health care and social security. The shift in age structure will result in increased dependency of retirees on the working-age population in the next 20 years. Mexico does not provide universal coverage of social security benefits and less than half of the labor force is covered by any pension or retirement plan. As a result, elderly Mexicans often continue working into old age. The high total poverty rate in the country, especially among the older population magnifies the problem of the potential dependency burden. The article ends with a discussion of key public policy issues related to aging in Mexico.},

Social and economic conditions have been studied as determinants of migration, but violence has received less attention. We examine how social networks and violence function to promote emigration from Colombia by linking event-history data from the Latin American Migration Project to external data on violence and economic conditions. We show that emigration is more likely to be initiated by those with higher education, those with network connections to migrants, and during periods of greater violence and increased police presence. Although violence acts powerfully to determine when people migrate, the geographic distribution of social capital determines where they go. Not surprisingly, migrants go to locations where people in their social networks are currently living or have been earlier.},

First, we estimate the predicted, purchasing-power adjusted wages of people inside and outside the United States who are otherwise observably identical-with the same country of birth, country of education, years of education, work experience, sex, and rural or urban residence. We use new and uniquely rich micro-data on the wages and characteristics of over two million individual formal-sector wage-earners in 43 countries (including the US). Second, we examine the extent to which these wage ratios for observably equivalent workers may overstate the gains to a marginal mover because movers may be positively selected on unobservable productivity in their home country. New evidence for nine of the countries, combined with a range of existing evidence, suggests that this overstatement can be significant, but is typically modest in magnitude. Third, we estimate the degree to which policy barriers to labor movement in and of themselves sustain the place premium, by bounding the premium observed under self-selected migration alone. Finally, we show that the policy-induced portion of the place premium in wages represents one of the largest remaining price distortions in any global market; is much larger than wage discrimination in spatially integrated markets; and makes labor mobility capable of reducing households' poverty at the margin by much more than any known in situ intervention.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32781-8},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: 258 million people reside outside their country of birth; however, to date no global systematic reviews or meta-analyses of mortality data for these international migrants have been done. We aimed to review and synthesise available mortality data on international migrants.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases for observational studies, systematic reviews, and randomised controlled trials published between Jan 1, 2001, and March 31, 2017, without language restrictions. We included studies reporting mortality outcomes for international migrants of any age residing outside their country of birth. Studies that recruited participants exclusively from intensive care or high dependency hospital units, with an existing health condition or status, or a particular health exposure were excluded. We also excluded studies limited to maternal or perinatal outcomes. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted data from published reports. The main outcomes were all-cause and International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) cause-specific standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and absolute mortality rates. We calculated summary estimates using random-effects models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017073608.
FINDINGS: Of the 12 480 articles identified by our search, 96 studies were eligible for inclusion. The studies were geographically diverse and included data from all global regions and for 92 countries. 5464 mortality estimates for more than 15·2 million migrants were included, of which 5327 (97\%) were from high-income countries, 115 (2\%) were from middle-income countries, and 22 ({\textless}1\%) were from low-income countries. Few studies included mortality estimates for refugees (110 estimates), asylum seekers (144 estimates), or labour migrants (six estimates). The summary estimate of all-cause SMR for international migrants was lower than one when compared with the general population in destination countries (0·70 [95\% CI 0·65-0·76]; I2=99·8\%). All-cause SMR was lower in both male migrants (0·72 [0·63-0·81]; I2=99·8\%) and female migrants (0·75 [0·67-0·84]; I2=99·8\%) compared with the general population. A mortality advantage was evident for refugees (SMR 0·50 [0·46-0·54]; I2=89·8\%), but not for asylum seekers (1·05 [0·89-1·24]; I2=54·4\%), although limited data was available on these groups. SMRs for all causes of death were lower in migrants compared with the general populations in the destination country across all 13 ICD-10 categories analysed, with the exception of infectious diseases and external causes. Heterogeneity was high across the majority of analyses. Point estimates of all-cause age-standardised mortality in migrants ranged from 420 to 874 per 100 000 population.
INTERPRETATION: Our study showed that international migrants have a mortality advantage compared with general populations, and that this advantage persisted across the majority of ICD-10 disease categories. The mortality advantage identified will be representative of international migrants in high-income countries who are studying, working, or have joined family members in these countries. However, our results might not reflect the health outcomes of more marginalised groups in low-income and middle-income countries because little data were available for these groups, highlighting an important gap in existing research. Our results present an opportunity to reframe the public discourse on international migration and health in high-income countries.

Drawing upon 30 years of experience in Central America, hundreds of interviews, and analyses of the vast documentary materials, Susanne Jonas masterfully explains not only how the Guatemalan tragedies, the U.S. involvement, and the stumbling 1990s peace process developed. She also raises fundamental questions about the badly misunderstood and much over-hyped 'democratic transition' supposedly occurring in Guatemala and elsewhere in the region." —Walter LaFeber Cornell University, author of Inevitable Revolutions: The United States in Central America},
