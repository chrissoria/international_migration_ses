	abstract = {Background Latinos represent the fastest growing proportion of dementia cases among different ethnic groups. Most of the studies in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) include Latino populations within the same group, failing to sufficiently account for the real richness of linguistic, ethnic, ancestry, cultural, and socioeconomic diversity represented across Latino communities (e.g., Caribbean-Hispanic vs Non Caribbean-Hispanics), yet there is substantial AD disparities and disease heterogeneity among Hispanic groups. Methods The Caribbean-American Dementia and Aging Study (CADAS) is a multinational initiative aimed to answer key questions regarding dementia determinants and consequences in Caribbean-origin populations in origin communities as well as among emigrant populations in the United States. By building a collaborative team of leading Caribbean and U.S-based dementia researches, CADAS will analyze differences in dementia prevalence and risk factor profiles between Caribbean-Hispanics living in the main Hispanic Caribbean Islands and extend comparisons to Hispanic immigrant groups in the US as well as non-Hispanic whites, exploiting the considerable difference in life course risk exposures across these populations. Results Preliminary findings from the CADAS study indicate that prevalence of dementia in the older Caribbean population is high, both in the main islands and in U.S. compared to non-Hispanic-whites. We found overall weaker associations between education and dementia probability in the three main Caribbean islands. By contrast, a stronger association between education and dementia probability was found in the US among non-Hispanic whites, Mexican Hispanics, and non-Mexican Hispanics; these persist even after controlling for income and wealth. Conclusions There are differential associations between SES risk factors, education, and dementia probability between Caribbean islands and the U.S., which may be attributed to differences across societies in risk factors correlated with education. The CADAS study will fill a critical gap in AD knowledge, exploiting rich variation in life-course exposures to better disentangle genetic versus environmental determinants of dementia levels and disparities. Future studies within this populations will focus on early-life socioeconomic status, gene by environment interactions and societal cost.},

	abstract = {Migration to the United States is an intricate part of Puerto Rican life ever since Puerto Rico became a colony of the United States in 1898. Our review of literature on Puerto Rican migration to the United States reveals that this migration is primarily associated with cycles of economic turmoil that result from over a century of U.S. colonialism in Puerto Rico. We also discuss how the pre- and post-migration context Puerto Ricans face influence their mental health. Emerging theory suggests that Puerto Rican migration to the United States should be conceptualized as colonial migration. Within this framework, researchers argue that U.S. colonialism in Puerto Rico not only creates the conditions that help explain why Puerto Ricans migrate to the United States but also the circumstances they encounter upon migration.},

The review uncovers significant support for all theories, suggesting that they constitute complementary rather than competing explanations of migration. One criticism is that far too much research is focused on Mexico, whose unique relationship to the United States may make it unrepresentative of broader patterns and trends in migration. After discussing salient gaps in the research record and outlining promising directions for future study, the article attempts to construct a comprehensive model for understanding immigration into North America.},
